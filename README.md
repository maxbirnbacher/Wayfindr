## Features/Roadmap

### Definitely planned

- [x] Route Navigation
- [x] POIs search in reachable area (needs some UI improvements and only works with rendered POIs)
- [ ] POI search
- [ ] Route/POI sharing by copying link (unclear what type of link, maybe a Google Maps link)

### Maybe planned

- [ ] Route/POI sharing by GPX file
- [ ] Implementation of popup with POI information from TripAdvisor (like Apple Maps)
- [ ] Implementation of weather information (maybe also forecast)

### Necessary for future deployment

- [ ] Authentication for users (either IdP or something of my own)
- [ ] Pipeline for automatic deployment
